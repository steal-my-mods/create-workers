Draws the images the CurseForge project page is built out of.

A project page is the only part of this mod most people ever see, and until now its
art was one file -- the badge from generate_logo.py -- made by hand-running a script
with a size flag. Everything else would have been a screenshot, which is a thing
nobody can regenerate: change the Station's texture and the shot showing it is wrong,
silently, for as long as the page lives.

So the page art is generated from the same assets the game loads. The sprites and the
block models are read off disk, the names are read out of the lang file, and the
Station's lamps are placed from the constants in generate_block_textures.py rather
than from numbers copied to a third place. Re-run this after changing any of that and
the page catches up.

    python3 tools/generate_page_art.py                 # everything, into branding/
    python3 tools/generate_page_art.py --only canteen  # one sheet, while iterating
    python3 tools/generate_page_art.py --out /tmp/art  # somewhere else

What comes out:

    banner.png          1280x640, the hero: the name and the three things it adds.
    card-<thing>.png    960x540 apiece, one per entry in SUBJECTS -- the thing drawn
                        large with its name and a line about it.
    recipe-<thing>.png  the crafting grid for every shaped recipe this mod ships,
                        read out of data/createworkers/recipe and drawn from it, so a
                        recipe that is rebalanced redraws rather than going stale.

The recipe sheets are mostly other people's sprites -- andesite alloy is Create's, dye
and planks are Mojang's -- and none of it is copied into this repo. They are read out
of the jars Gradle has already cached, at the moment the picture is drawn, so what is
kept here is a finished image and not somebody else's texture. That needs a build to
have run once; the banner and the cards need nothing.

**What this cannot draw is a worker.** The mod's own art is an item sprite, two block
models and a gear sheet; a villager in a hard hat and a hi-vis vest only exists once
vanilla's model, its textures and WorkerGearModels.fitTo have all met inside a running
client. That picture is the mod's best one, and it has to be a screenshot. The gallery
wants those -- docs/curseforge-page.md says which ones and what should be in them;
this covers the rest of the page, and covers it repeatably.

Adding a thing to the page is one entry in SUBJECTS. Its card comes for free, the
banner grows a column, and its recipe draws itself.

Style is the badge's, deliberately: the same blue graph paper, the same white keyline
and the same soft shadow, because a project page and the icon beside it in a mod list
reading as one family is most of what the badge is for. The palette is imported from
generate_logo rather than restated, so retuning it there moves the whole page.

Nothing here needs anything outside the standard library, and every pixel is a pure
function of the files in this repo -- so re-running it on another machine produces
byte-identical files, which is what lets the output be committed and diffed.
